# Stick PK Game
Stick PK Game is a game for parkour enthusiasts that is inspired by the game of "Horse" in basketball. In this game, players take turns challenging each other to complete a parkour move or sequence. If a player fails to complete the challenge, they receive a letter, starting with "S" and continuing with "T", "I", "C", and "K". Once a player receives all five letters, they are out of the game. The last player standing is the winner!

Stick PK Game also includes a feature for random prompts to challenge the players. This feature can be used to generate prompts for the players to incorporate into their parkour moves or sequences.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Framer Motion, Local Storage

Stick PK Game is a single-page web application built using React and Framer Motion. The game data, including player names and letters, is stored in Local Storage, allowing players to pick up where they left off if they leave the game and return later.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing Stick PK Game was a great opportunity to improve my skills in React and Framer Motion, as well as learn about working with Local Storage. I also gained experience in designing and developing a game that is fun and challenging for parkour enthusiasts. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and a lot of fun to build!
